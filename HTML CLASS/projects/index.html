    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>Hi, I am Dusten Stahl, I am a gamer who wants to be a video game developer. So, I am taking this html-CSS cores to understand coding at Butler community college to get my diploma of an associate degree. 
    and once I get that I am going to move up to a bigger school to further my education my goal it to get a bachelor's or a master's degree. Right now, I am working a moderate-income job. Once I get my associate degree, 
    I am going to look for a job that will fit in that category. So, I can get experience in the field how long I have been coding for before collage none I dabbled in it but never understood it, but it did peak my entrust.
